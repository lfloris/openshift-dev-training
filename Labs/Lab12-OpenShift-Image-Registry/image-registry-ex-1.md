# Exercise 1 - Using the OpenShift Image Registry

In this lab we'll explore how to push local images to our OpenShift Image Registry to use in an application. In this exercise we'll locally build a Python image as a base, create a new application from that image and push that image to the OpenShift Image Registry.

To get started, log into OpenShift using the CLI, as described [here](../Getting-started/log-in-to-openshift.md).

A set of helpful common `oc` commands can be found [here](../Getting-started/oc-commands.md).

Once you're logged in, create a new project for this deployment.

```
$ oc new-project lab12-image-reg
```

Get the image registry endpoint from OpenShift. This is a Route in the `openshift-image-registry` project.
```
$ HOST=$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry --template='{{ .spec.host }}')
```

Log in to the registry
```
$ docker login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) ${HOST}
Login succeeded!
```

Build the `my-python` image that was used in [Lab01](../Lab01-Building-a-container/custom-docker-image-ex-4.md). You may already have this image locally built, so you can use that instead of repeating that lab exercise. For this example, the local image name is `mypython` and for the tag we'll use `latest`.

Tag the image to match our image registry endpoint and project. The format is `[IMAGE_REGISTRY_ROUTE]/[PROJECT]/[IMAGE_NAME]:[TAG]`
```
$ docker tag mypython:latest  ${HOST}/lab12-image-reg/mypython:latest
```

Push the image to the registry
```
$ docker push ${HOST}/lab12-image-reg/mypython:latest
The push refers to repository [default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.demo.ibmdte.net/lab12-image-reg/mypython]

```

Now we can try pulling it again to make sure we're able to pull it from the OpenShift Image Registry

```
$ docker pull ${HOST}/lab12-image-reg/mypython:latest
latest: Pulling from lab12-image-reg/mypython
Digest: sha256:80c3acca19257e5118afdd082907b8450d02f7e0188d9d3e993e5fee8b691bf8
Status: Image is up to date for default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.demo.ibmdte.net/lab12-image-reg/mypython:latest
```

Images pushed to the built-in registry automatically get an ImageStream created for us. We can use this ImageStream to reference our image from the registry without specifying the full image name with the host URL. We can view this using `oc get imagestreams`

```
$ oc get imagestreams
NAME       IMAGE REPOSITORY                                                                       TAGS        UPDATED
mypython   default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.demo.ibmdte.net/lab12-image-reg/mypython   latest      About a minute ago
```

Now we can create a new application based on the image we just pushed. For this, we'll use a shortcut available from the `oc` cli to create a new DeploymentConfig from the image name. 

Create the DeploymentConfig using the `mypython:latest` image
```
$ oc create deploymentconfig mypython --image=mypython:latest
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/mypython created
```

To enable the DeploymentConfig to find the image from the ImageStream, we need to enable image lookups on the `mypython` DeploymentConfig

```
$ oc set image-lookup dc/mypython
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/mypython image lookup updated
```

Now check that the pods are running

```
$ oc get pods
NAME                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
mypython-2-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          3m
mypython-2-lghlp    1/1     Running     0          2m57s
```

Check the DeploymentConfig `mypython` using `oc get deploymentconfig mypython -o yaml` and look at the `triggers` field. It's currently only set to `type: ConfigChange`. This means that if there are any changes to the actual deployment specification, a new set of pods will be rolled out. in most cases this is fine, but during development we might want to enable automated rollouts of a new image version when I push a new image to the registry. We can do this by adding a new `trigger` to the DeploymentConfig. Thee `oc` cli provides an easy way to add this trigger by using `oc set triggers` and providing the DeploymentConfig name, the imagestream and the container name.
```
$ oc set triggers deploymentconfig/mypython --from-image=mypython:latest -c default-container
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/mypython triggers updated
```

Now check the DeploymentConfig again. This time the `triggers` section has a new configuration

```
  - imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true
      containerNames:
      - default-container
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: mypython:latest
        namespace: lab12-image-reg
      lastTriggeredImage: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/lab12-image-reg/mypython@sha256:80c3acca19257e5118afdd082907b8450d02f7e0188d9d3e993e5fee8b691bf8
    type: ImageChange
```

Now each time we push a new version of the `mypython:latest` image, the DeploymentConfig should rollout a new version of our application

The following steps demonstrate how this works

```
#get the current pods

$ oc get pods
NAME                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
mypython-2-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          6m57s
mypython-4-6b8w4    1/1     Running     0          61s
mypython-4-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          64s

# build, create and push a new version of the mypython application with 3.6-slim instead of 2.7-slim

$ vim app.py 
$ vim Dockerfile

# remove (or retag) the old version of "latest"

$ docker rmi ${HOST}/lab12-image-reg/mypython:latest
